# .zshenv is always sourced. It often contains exported variables that should be available to other
# programs. For example, $PATH, $EDITOR, and $PAGER are often set in .zshenv. Also, you can set
# $ZDOTDIR in .zshenv to specify an alternative location for the rest of your zsh configuration.

# * Note, if you want an environment var to take effect even for GUI apps (aka .desktop shortcuts), add the environment vars to ~/.config/environment.d/
# export MOZ_ENABLE_WAYLAND=1
