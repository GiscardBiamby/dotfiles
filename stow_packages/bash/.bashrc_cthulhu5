# Run-time modifying stuff (e.g., PATH, )

## CPU / GPU
## This workaround no longer works with newer Intel MKL lib versions.
# # For AMD CPU's, set this so that Intel MKL library will use AVX2 optimizations
# if (lscpu | grep "AMD Ryzen"); then
#     export MKL_DEBUG_CPU_TYPE=5

## CUDA
## For home desktop only. The way I installed the NVIDIA drivers made it necessary to set these
## manually for some reason:
export CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}
export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin${PATH:+:${PATH}}
## Arch list for compiling some pytorch projects, DeepFill, and the other hackathon one:
# export TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST="Turing,Ampere"
export TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST=7.5
# export TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST=8.6
## To force the nvidia-smi GPU order to be the same as the GPU device ordinals in pytorch:
export CUDA_DEVICE_ORDER=PCI_BUS_ID

# set PATH for cuda 10.1 installation
if [ -d "/usr/local/cuda/bin/" ]; then
    export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin${PATH:+:${PATH}}
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}
fi
